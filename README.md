# Factorio Bulldozer Mod

This mod allows a player to demolish items at an astounding rate.  The main function of the bulldozer is toggled via in-game GUI in the upper right hand corner.

## Notes, etc

DO NOT RUN A PLAYER OVER WITH DEATHCHEST INSTALLED.  I cannot stress that enough; YOU WILL CRASH THE SERVER! (Saves un-affected, upon restart you will go to the last save available.)
